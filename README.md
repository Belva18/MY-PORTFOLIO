# My Portfolio

## Overview

This is a modernized personal portfolio website showcasing my background, academic journey, goals, projects, and contact information. Built with HTML, custom CSS, and JavaScript, the website features a sleek, dark-themed design with a sticky navigation bar, hamburger menu for mobile devices, and client-side form validation. It reflects my journey as a level 200 Information Technology student at Wisconsin International University.

## Features

- **Modern Design**: Dark theme with gradient accents, smooth animations, and Poppins font for a professional look.
- **Responsive Navigation**: Sticky navbar with a hamburger menu for mobile devices.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for the contact form with real-time feedback.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Hover effects and transitions for interactive elements.
- **Footer**: Includes placeholder social media links.
- **Multi-Page Structure**: Separate pages for Home, About, Academics, Goals, Projects, and Contact.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main page with a summary of all sections.
- `about.html`: Personal background information.
- `academics.html`: Academic history.
- `goals.html`: Future goals and ambitions.
- `projects.html`: List of projects.
- `contact.html`: Contact form with validation.
- `style.css`: Custom CSS for styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for hamburger menu and form validation.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Place all files in the same directory (`index.html`, `about.html`, `academics.html`, `goals.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the portfolio.
4. Navigate through the pages using the navigation menu.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: For custom styling, including gradients, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For hamburger menu toggle and form validation.
- **Google Fonts (Poppins)**: For modern typography.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a backend (e.g., Node.js, PHP) to handle form submissions.
- Add project details with images and links.
- Enhance accessibility with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
- Deploy to a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages) for public access.
- Add animations for page transitions.
